# TTS Debug Tool Demo

This repository simulates a simplified version of a text processing pipeline with a bug caused by **"double cleaning"** the text input affecting text-to-speech(TTS) synthesis. 

## Background
The intended flow was:
1. Clean the assistant output once.
2. Send the cleaned text to the TTS module.

However, the system unintentionally applied the same cleaning logic twice â€” once during an earlier processing stage, and again right before sending to TTS. This led to the cleaned text being reduced to an empty string or malformed format.

Detailed logging in both `priorPipelineProcessing` and `cleanTextPipeline` helped trace the intermediate data transformations and isolate the cause of the failure.

## Functions

- `priorPipelineProcessing()`: Simulates the original processing that mistakenly already includes cleaning.
- `cleanTextPipeline()`: The main cleaning logic
- `pipelineWithBug()`: Combines both, showing how the bug manifested.
- `sendToTTSFunction()`: Placeholder for sending to TTS, logs what text was sent

## Summary
This demo highlights how thorough logging and breaking down pipeline stages can expose hidden bugs such as redundant processing. The approach showcased here can be adapted to debugging complex real-time backend systems like TTS pipelines, improving reliability and maintainability.
